## Hi, I'm Leandro ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm a computer engineer working in Curitiba, Brazil

<!-- #### I'm a computer engineer working in Floripa (Magic Island), Brazil -->

I have focused my studies on Fullstack development and Mobile UX Design.

As a front end and mobile developer, I seek to improve my skills in Javascript technologies such as React and React Native. As a back end developer, I have focused for building systems with NodeJS (Javascript again).

In my spare time, I have been studying and developing small projects in data science and chatbots. Finally, as not everything is just programming, as a hobby I seek to play the guitar to relax

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Mobile Apps with Flutter

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: tech, cars, movies, music, guitar
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ I use daily: `.dart`, `.cs`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.html`, `.css`
