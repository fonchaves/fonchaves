## Hi, I'm Leandro ðŸ‘‹

#### #### I'm a computer engineer working in FlorianÃ³polis, Brazil

I have focused my studies on Full Stack development and Mobile UX Design.

Currently, I am focused on enhancing my skills as a back-end developer, working on maintaining and developing API services using NestJS and Typescript. Additionally, I am working on personal projects using Golang.

As a front-end and Mobile developer, I have extensive experience with Flutter and Dart. However, I have also worked with JavaScript, React, and Next.JS.

I am passionate about working on projects related to Sustainability, e-mobility, and Green Energy.

Finally, as not everything is just programming, as a hobby I seek to play electric guitar to relax.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Mobile Apps with Flutter
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working with NestJS and Typescript
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: tech, cars, e-mobility, movies, music, guitar
- âš¡ I use daily: `.dart`,`.tsx`, `.ts` `.js`, `.go`, `.java`, `.html`, `.css`

Feel free to contact me through my LinkedIn profile or email.
